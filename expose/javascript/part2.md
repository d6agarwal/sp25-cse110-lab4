1. 3
   This is printed because the for loop runs 3 times. After i=2 becomes i=3 because of i++, executions stops because i < 3 (length of the array) is false. So, i=3 is the value of i that remains.
2. 150
   This is printed because the for loop runs until it is done executing the steps on the last element of the array which in our case is 300 and it applies a 50% discount on it which make it 150.
